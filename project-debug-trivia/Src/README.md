# Debug: Trivia for Insect Lovers

Mia Collymore Abbas, Nina Redpath, and Sarah Willis

This project is a multiple-choice trivia game centered around bugs that increases with difficulty with each new level and corresponding new bug!

For the first iteration, we did the following: 

- set up our repo and kanban board <br />
- mapped out the general structure of our code (in terms of classes, interfaces etc) <br />
- created a level one class and player class that hold information  <br />
- created the basic play loop so that one level can be played ** note that the trivia is placeholder questions, not real trivia yet. <br />
- created a score system that updates when a question is correct. <br />

For this next iteration, we: <br />
- added the rest of the levels <br />
- inputed real trivia <br />
- made the instructions more user-friendly. <br />
- made the level increment when the current level is finished <br />
- added unit testing <br />
	
Usage: 
	please download the repository and navigate to it in your terminal 
	
	run Javac Play.java
	run java Play. 
	have fun!! 
	
** Note that the responses to the trivia questions should be the corresponding letter of the answer

For the next and final iteration, we will: <br/>
- prevent users from entering invalid inputs <br/>
- create a script the program can run from <br/>
- add a way for users to track local scores <br/>
- end the game after the last level.
